- Send a warning message before cleaning items.
- Shows periodic messages informing about the time remaining until the next cleaning.
- Allows you to customize warning and cleaning messages.
- Reports the number of items removed after each cleaning.

## Facility

1. Download the plugin and unzip it if necessary.
2. Place the `ClearLag` folder in the `plugins` directory of your PocketMine-MP server.
3. Start or restart your PocketMine-MP server to load the plugin.

## Setting

The configuration file `config.yml` is located in the `resources/ClearLag/config.yml` folder. You can edit this file to adjust cleaning intervals and customize messages. Below is an example of the default configuration:
